A quick image slider for "The Odin project" image slider. It functions and performs properly but for the future I would make some alterations.

Would make the code neater for one, keeping all of the interactions only in javascript.

Would use less global variables.

Would also like to see the slide number on every picture, and have arrows on the images that allow the images to change in a clockwise or counterclockwise order.
